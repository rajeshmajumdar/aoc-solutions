# Advent of Code 2021 - Solutions [CPP]

### Day 1 - Sonar Sweep
---
This challenge was actually prety simple, although I am not so sure whether my solution is efficient or not. But I got both the stars, so I am gonna roll with this only.

```console
$ g++ day1.cc && ./a.out
```
### Day 2 - Dive
---
This one was actually simpler than day1 chal in my opinion.

```console
$ g++ day2.cc && ./a.out
```
